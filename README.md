I really liked this thread because the original post was about COVID-19 and the new Omicron variant, and every single comment underneath it not only has nothing to do with the original post, but they're all very different from each other as well. I found it amusing that such a coincidece could occur. My comment is about Dan Crenshaw, but the ones underneath mine are about a range of topics, from UK PM Boris Johnson to Preisdent Chodosh to Bernie Sanders

I believe I should get a 30/30, because I completed all six tasks, made the GitHub repo, which is 20, and did extra credit options 1,2,4,6, and 7a. I didn't do extra credit option 3,5,and 7b.
